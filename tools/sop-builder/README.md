# SOP & Checklist Builder

> Type the steps and print a clean SOP or tick-box checklist with sign-off lines.

Part of [Admin Desk Tools](../../README.md). Runs entirely in your browser and works without internet.

## What it does

Write a standard operating procedure by typing one step per line (action, owner, minutes, note). The tool numbers the steps, totals the time, works out the next review date, and prints an A4 SOP or checklist with sign-off lines.

## Quick start

**No technical knowledge needed**

1. Download this folder (or the whole project as a ZIP from GitHub) and unzip it.
2. Double-click `index.html`. It opens in your browser and works with no internet connection.
3. Keep the folder anywhere you like - on your desktop or a USB stick. It never needs updating to keep working.

**For developers**

```bash
npm install          # once, at the repository root
npm run serve        # then open http://localhost:8080/tools/sop-builder/
```

Hosting this folder on any static web host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, an intranet web server) needs no build step. See [docs/HOSTING.md](../../docs/HOSTING.md). To publish only this tool as its own repository, run `npm run export-tool -- sop-builder ../sop-builder-repo`.

## Features

- Header with document number, version, owner, department, effective date and review period.
- SOP or checklist format; optional tick boxes; purpose and scope sections.
- Reorder steps; validation for missing title or owners.
- PDF (extra pages for long procedures), steps CSV; save and reopen as `.json`.

## How it works

`js/core.js` exports `SopCore`: `create`, `parseSteps`, `stepsToText`, `moveStep`, `totalMinutes`, `duration`, `reviewDate`, `validate`, `toCsv`, `sanitize`, `buildPdf`, `serialize` and `parse`.

| File                 | Purpose                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.html`         | Page structure and the Content-Security-Policy (blocks all network access)                          |
| `css/theme.css`      | Shared look and feel, light/dark. Synced from `shared/` - do not edit here                          |
| `css/app.css`        | Styles for this tool only                                                                           |
| `js/common.js`       | Shared helpers (downloads, file reading, status messages). Synced from `shared/` - do not edit here |
| `js/core.js`         | The logic: pure functions, unit-tested, no browser needed                                           |
| `js/app.js`          | Connects the page to the logic (thin by design)                                                     |
| `vendor/`            | Bundled third-party code: pdf-lib 1.17.1 (MIT)                                                      |
| `tests/core.test.js` | Unit tests for the logic                                                                            |

## Privacy and security

- Everything happens in your browser. Nothing you open, type or create is sent anywhere.
- The page's Content-Security-Policy (`<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">`) forbids network requests, inline scripts and `eval`, so even a bug could not send your data out.
- Third-party code is bundled in `vendor/` (exact versions and licenses in `vendor/README.md`) instead of loaded from a CDN, so there is no third party in the loop when you use the tool.
- Keep the files you save (`.json`, `.csv`, `.pdf`) in a folder only the right people can open. They are not password-protected.

## Limitations

- The PDF carries no digital signature or version control: sign on paper and file it in your document system.
- PDF fonts are Latin only.
- The sample SOP is an example, not a recommended procedure. Treat results as working aids and check anything important before acting on it.

## Development

```bash
npm test                                                     # all tools, from the repository root
node --test tools/sop-builder/tests/core.test.js   # just this tool
npm run verify                                               # tests + lint + formatting + repository checks
```

The logic in `js/core.js` has no browser dependencies, so you can reuse it from Node: `const core = require('./js/core.js');`

Conventions (pure `core.js`, thin `app.js`, tests for every function) are described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) and [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
