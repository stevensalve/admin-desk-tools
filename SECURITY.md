# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue for a security problem. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting: on the repository page choose _Security -> Report a vulnerability_. Include the tool name, what you did, what you expected and what happened, and (if possible) a small file that reproduces it. We aim to acknowledge reports within a few days and to publish a fix and credit you (if you wish) once it is released.

## Supported versions

Only the latest release on the `main` branch is supported.

## Threat model in one paragraph

These tools process files that users open on their own computer. The main risks are (1) a malicious file exploiting a parser, (2) a bug leaking data over the network, and (3) tampered third-party code. The design answers each: parsers are well-known open-source libraries pinned to exact versions and bundled in `vendor/`; every page ships a Content-Security-Policy with `connect-src 'none'` plus `script-src 'self'` (no inline scripts, no `eval`) and CI fails if a page references an external resource; and libraries are never loaded from a CDN.

## Notes for specific components

- **Personal and business data.** Visitor names and phone numbers, rosters, contracts, incidents and travel details are sensitive. The Visitor Log keeps only the last four characters of an ID number. Nothing is uploaded or stored by the tools, but the files you download (PDFs, CSVs, `.json`) are ordinary files: they are not password-protected. Store and share them securely and delete them when no longer needed.
- **SheetJS** is taken from the vendor's own distribution (`cdn.sheetjs.com`, version 0.20.3) because the copy on npm is outdated and known to be vulnerable. Spreadsheet cells are treated as text; exported CSV files guard against formula injection (cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` are prefixed with an apostrophe).
- **Saved `.json` files** (visitor log, room booking, maintenance, incident log, purchase order, travel request, SOP builder) are validated and sanitised when opened, and user text is only ever written to the page with `textContent`.
- **Samples and targets** (GST rates, response targets, example SOPs, policy caps) are illustrations, not advice. Wrong calculations are a correctness problem rather than a vulnerability, but please report them as bugs.

## Known `npm audit` findings

Run `npm audit` after installing. At the time of writing there are no known findings for the development tooling; the bundled browser libraries are pinned and recorded in each tool's `vendor/README.md`. Re-check whenever dependencies are updated.

## What is out of scope

- Attacks that require the attacker to already control the user's browser or operating system.
- Passes, purchase orders, travel requests and SOPs are plain PDFs without a digital signature or password; that is documented behaviour, not a vulnerability.
